WordPress Install
=================

A python script to aid in the installation of WordPress. Just set your 
configuration options and set the script loose, it should only take a 
few seconds to run and completely install everything from database, 
downloading the latest WordPress to getting it fully installed and 
operational.

Work in Progress
================

This is currently a work in progress, it started out as more of a proof 
of concept but now I'm in the process of making it something better. I 
would love it if others joined in too, see a bug or something that needs 
improvement? Jump right in; pull requests are welcome.

List
----

 - Actually use a configuration file.
 - Interface with another server 
 - Finish implementing the file settings bit
 - There's most likely more...
